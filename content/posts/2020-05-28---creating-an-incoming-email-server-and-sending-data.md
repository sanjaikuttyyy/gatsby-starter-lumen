This is a quick writeup on what I was doing for the past couple of day and night. So, possibly this could be a wrong approach or something that is easily hackable or whatsoever. Any comments on this is appreciated and please feel free to [DM me on twitter.](https://twitter.com/nav_devl "Twitter")

## The initial idea

This is what I was actually trying to do. I wanted to setup an incoming mail server(as this is an initial quick idea, no security elements will be involved in this blog) and I wanted to catch-all the emails that are coming to my email server, get the payload and hit an API endpoint where I can do some further secret magic.

## The requirements

There's always a recipe to any magic that has been established in the history. Coming to our magical idea, we need the following items.

* Domain name. (Mine is [slooshers.xyz](), found it cheap, bought it quick)
* A very small instance. (Be it [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/) or [digitalocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) or anything that you love. I am currently going with digitalocean because I have some free credits) Ubuntu 16.04 is my usual choice.
* Basic understanding of linux
* Patience

## Configuring the domain

Assuming, by now, you have bought your domain and also have your instance started. So, now we have two elements to configure in the domain's DNS.

1. MX Record
2. A Record

As per wiki, A mail exchanger **record** (**MX record**) specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain name. It is a resource **record** in the Domain Name System (DNS).

Here's my configuration of the MX record. Now, in my case, my MX record points to a subdomain "mailer" of the domain "slooshers.xyz"

![Configuring the MX Record](/media/screenshot-2020-05-28-at-9-56-48-pm.png)

So, let us go and configure the A record for mailer and point that A record to our instance's public IP.

Inorder to go find your public IP, you need to roam around your instance dashboard a little. In Digital ocean, it is always on the droplet screen, like below.![](/media/screenshot-2020-05-28-at-9-58-31-pm.png)

The ipv4 is my slooshers.xyz IP

So, let's go configure the A record in few seconds.

![](/media/screenshot-2020-05-28-at-10-00-07-pm.png)

Boom! Done. This might take like 2-5minutes for the DNS to properly reflect the changes. But that is all. You can maybe have a quick walk to your balcony and come back.

## Testing the configuration

There are few online services to check if you A name and MX record configurations are established properly. I tested mine at [https://mxtoolbox.com/](https://mxtoolbox.com/ "https://mxtoolbox.com/")

## Installing Postfix

As per wiki, **_Postfix_** is a free and open-source [mail transfer agent (MTA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_transfer_agent) that routes and delivers electronic mail. In order to understand the complete workflow of how email works, there are tons of resources out there and we aren't covering them in this post. You can still go refer to these below resources where I found some ideas on the email and how everything happens.

Now, let us roll our sleeves and start our work.

 1. First ssh into your instance. Once you are in, make sure to update it by running `apt-get update`
 2. Change your hostname value because this will be very much needed in a lot of places. Run `vi /etc/hostname/` and change the value to **mailer** and save it.
 3. Verify it by typing `hostname -f` in the command line to check your FQQN. Mine will display the following  
    _root@mailer:\~# hostname -f_

    _mailer.slooshers.xyz_
 4. Then install postfix by running `apt-get install postfix`
 5. Postfix installation will ask you to go through a wizard workflow to setup.

    ![](/media/screenshot-2020-05-28-at-11-20-07-pm.png)
 6. Choose **Internet Site**
 7. Now, verify if your hostname if properly filled as per the FQDN.
 8. For **Root and postmaster mail recipient,** just for now you can leave this blank
 9. In the other destinations make sure both mailer.yourdomain.com and yourdomain.com exists. Because this is very much needed as per our story line.
10. Other things, you can just go with default.

If any of the above steps didn't occur to you, you can run `dpkg-reconfigure postfix` and reconfigure again. Don't sweat.

Right now, we are at 50% work done.

## Get the incoming mails in

Most our work is going to revolve around postfix's configuration from now on. You can find the postfix configuration files at `/etc/postfix.`

Preferably cd into that directory for more ease.

You will find **main.cf** file inside the directory which is going to cover almost what we are going to go with here. So, I am cutting down a lot of elements in here to explain each of the configuration variables inside **main.cf** and going to share the configuration that I am currently using.

    smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name $mail_version
    biff = no
    
    append_dot_mydomain = no
    readme_directory = no
    compatibility_level = 2
    
    myhostname = mailer.slooshers.xyz
    myorigin = /etc/mailname
    mydestination = mailer.slooshers.xyz, mailer.slooshers.xyz, slooshers.xyz, localhost.slooshers.xyz, , localhost
    relayhost =
    mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128 167.71.230.101
    mailbox_size_limit = 0
    recipient_delimiter = +
    inet_interfaces = all
    inet_protocols = all
    
    alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
    alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
    transport_maps = regexp:/etc/postfix/redirect.regexp
    
    smtpd_relay_restrictions = permit_mynetworks permit_sasl_authenticated defer_unauth_destination

Most probably except for **transport_maps** you might have a lot of other things in there.

Like I said earlier, we aren't writing this with any security installed, so we can remove sasl related vars. _You can use my part of snippet and edit a little of your own._

Few things you might have to edit is,

1. Adding your instance ip to the **mynetworks**
2. Adding **transport_maps** to transport mail to a postfix pipe.

### What is a catch-all email?

So usually, in a usual email setup, each user has an email. i.e, for one email to be present, we need to create a user. But a catch-all email is a simple nice trick where you actually catch any email set to your mailer domain and redirect it to the same user.

In our to do the catch-all emailing, we need to create an alias.  
So if you check our configuration we have alias_maps pointing to `/etc/aliases` . Let us open the file and add this following configuration

`@slooshers.xyz root`

and save it. _The above line does the following trick._

_Say you are sending email to naveen@slooshers.xyz, this will be redirected to root user. Say you are sending email to honest@slooshers.xyz, it will also be redirected to the root user. Nice trick. So, there's no email rejection happen in this case._

Now are are all set, let us try sending email. Before sending have your mail log file opened to see the log when a mail is received by your system.

Run `tail -f /var/log/mail.log` to get your log running.

Sending email... and you see this following log in your console.![](/media/screenshot-2020-05-28-at-11-38-17-pm.png)

Hurraayyyy. So, finally we started receiving email. Now, how can we pipe this email content into a script?

## Pipe the email to Script

Postfix has an approach calling piping where you pipe information to the other process, be it script or file or anything.

Before that we need to create our transport file.

We have mentioned a variable `transport_maps = regexp:/etc/postfix/redirect.regexp` and this is our guy.

Open `/etc/postfix/redirect.regexp` and enter this following regexp catpturer: `/^.*@slooshers\.xyz/ slooshershook:`

The first part is our email address capturer and the next part is the pipename. We will define the pipe's functionality in the master configuration file.

Open `/etc/postfix/master.cf` and add this simple line.

```bash
slooshershook unix - n n - - pipe flags=FR user=naveen argv=/usr/bin/python3 /home/scripts/webhook.py ${sender} ${recipient}
```

This one line will ping the script present in `/home/scripts/webhook.py` with arguments as **sender's email** and **receiver's email**. Now you might ask, where is the email content. That's the magic. So, while it is being piped, the content is in the **stdin** and when we are writing our script, we should make sure to read from the stdin.

### Adding a simple script for you.

Here's a script where it reads the content from the stdin and logs in a file.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import logging
import sys
from sys import stdin

logging.basicConfig(filename='/home/scripts/app.log', filemode='w', format='%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

content = ''
for line in stdin:
    content += line

logging.warning(content)
```


Now, the above code just dumps the content to log file. I guess with the above idea, you can actually do a lot more like, making a API request with the data of content as payload and parsing it with email libraries.

Actually if you really want to discuss more on this and see more on the complete thing I did, please feel free to ping me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/nav_devl "Twitter").
